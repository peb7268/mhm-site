            <p class="content-section__text">
                We are just like you; a small business. As such we treat our clients as people and understand their needs. We take the time to understand your business, look for what opportunities you may be missing, and help you craft and execute your plan.
            </p>
            <p class="content-section__text">
                While business is good to have though, we believe in setting up our clients for success, not squeezing every dime we can get out of them like many marketing companies we run across. We love doing on-going work for our clients, but a lot of the marketing work that goes on behind the scenes once a site is created isn't rocket science. It just takes a little time and a bit of experience.
            </p>
            <p class="content-section__text">
                So when you want us to be your in-house marketing team, or just want us to set you up for success and then hand you the keys, we will make a solution that works best for your business and then be your go-to support afterwards for anything you need. This is what makes us different. We create customer-centric solutions. That is why many of our clients end up becoming our friends.

                        I needed help with my digital marketing because my previous marketing company went out of business in November 2018 and was in desperate need of getting my company's name out there on the web. I have a painting business and needed to advertise on Google ASAP. I asked a few other painting companies where they were getting their leads from and luckily I came across a company that referred me to Paul. I was a little hesitant at first but after seeing the other company's websites designed by Paul & Imperative Design and their setup on Google, I had to give him a shot. Boy am I glad I did. Not only did he build my site professionally but he also put me on Google and told me about all the different ways and options I could advertise on Google, Facebook, and Nextdoor. He gave me a lot of tools to work with to build my business online. I'm forever grateful. He knows his stuff and knows what he's doing. Highly recommend him and his team. Thank you Paul!

                        We started working with Imperative Design years ago. Through the years Paul and his team have designed and built several iterations of our site. It is clear from his attention to detail and the time he takes to craft a strategy that really fits our business, that we are more than a project to him. It's nice to work with a company that genuinely cares about how your business is going to do, and they take the time to get it right.

                        I met Paul through happenstance at a Starbucks one day and having my own development company myself we struck up a conversation. As it stands, that was an awesome stroke of serendipity. We have collaborated now on multiple projects. Given that the projects that we have collaborated on have had small room for error and high visibility, we are happy to be able to say Imperative Design puts out top-notch work and quickly has demonstrated to us the wide breadth of knowledge they have when it comes to full-stack development. Whether it is WordPress, Angular, or NativeScript, Paul has always given us great ideas when we have chatted over a cup of coffee and discussed projects.
