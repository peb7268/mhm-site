            <h2 class="content-section__title">Get your business started on the right foot</h2>
            <p class="content-section__text">
                In the past, businesses would advertise with billboards, flyers, ads in the newspaper, among other various types of media channels. Today however, many of these forms of advertising are becoming increasing less effective while new strategies and channels are emerging. If you want to be found by your target market, you need to arm your business with knowledge and know how and take advantage of these new channels.
            </p>
            <p class="content-section__text">
                The web is the modern advertising medium that can yield dramatic results for your business. From a simple Google search on a mobile to a query on a specific site like yelp or kudzu. These are the avenues that people are taking to find what they are looking for now.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-section__title">SEO: Search engine optimization</h2>
            <p class="content-section__text">
                SEO is the process of making your site attractive to search engines. It is the process of aligning your site and your business with the terms that potential customers are using to look for businesses like you. SEO is not a magic bullet that will make your P&L explode overnight. It is an essential. It puts you on equal footing with your competition and sets you up for the possibility of being found.

                Search engine optimization also provides unique opportunities to see what works for your business. That way you can do more of what works and less of what doesn't. You can see which cities people are finding you from, which social networks are sending you traffic, which keywords people are using to connect with you.
            </p>

            <h3 class="content-section__subtitle">Instant traffic | sustainable increases in inbound leads</h3>
